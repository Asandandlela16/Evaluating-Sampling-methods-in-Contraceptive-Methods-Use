📌 Project Overview

This project applies applied probability models and sampling theory to a real-world public health dataset to evaluate how different sampling designs influence the accuracy, precision, and reliability of statistical estimates.

Using data from the National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, we empirically compared multiple probability-based sampling methods to identify the most effective approach for estimating contraceptive use patterns among married women.

The project bridges theoretical statistical concepts and practical data-driven inference, demonstrating the real impact of sampling design decisions in applied statistics.

🎯 Objectives

Investigate factors influencing contraceptive method choice among married women

Compare the performance of multiple sampling techniques in estimating:

Contraceptive Method Used (categorical variable)

A derived proportion variable

Evaluate estimator precision using 95% confidence intervals

Identify the sampling method that produces the most reliable and precise estimates

📂 Dataset Description

Source: National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey

Population Size: 1,473 married women

Eligibility: Women not pregnant or uncertain of pregnancy status

Sample Size: 100 observations per sampling method

Variables

Response Variable:

Contraceptive method used

No use

Short-term use

Long-term use

Explanatory Variables (9):

Wife’s age

Wife’s education

Husband’s education

Number of children

Religion

Working status

Husband’s occupation

Standard of living

Media exposure

🧪 Sampling Methods Implemented

Simple Random Sampling with Replacement (SRSWR)

Simple Random Sampling without Replacement (SRSWOR)

Stratified Sampling

Stratification based on wife’s education

Proportional allocation across strata

Cluster Sampling

Clusters defined by husband’s occupation

Each method used the same sample size to ensure fair and meaningful comparison.

📈 Key Results & Findings

Stratified sampling consistently produced the most precise estimates

Narrower 95% confidence intervals

Lower variability

More stable population estimates

Simple random sampling methods performed reasonably but with higher variability

Cluster sampling showed the widest confidence intervals and least reliability

These results empirically confirm that sampling design plays a critical role in statistical inference, especially in heterogeneous populations.

🏆 Conclusion

The project demonstrated that stratified sampling is the most effective method for estimating contraceptive use in this dataset. By ensuring proportional representation of key subgroups, stratified sampling significantly improves estimator precision and reliability.

This study reinforces the importance of thoughtful sampling design in applied statistics, public health research, and real-world data analysis.

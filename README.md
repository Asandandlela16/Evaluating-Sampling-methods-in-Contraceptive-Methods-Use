## 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project applies **applied probability models and sampling theory** to a real-world public health dataset in order to evaluate how different sampling designs influence the **accuracy, precision, and reliability of statistical estimates**.

Using data from the **National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey**, we empirically compared multiple probability-based sampling methods to determine the most effective approach for estimating contraceptive use patterns among married women.

The project bridges **theoretical statistical concepts** with **practical, data-driven inference**, highlighting the real impact of sampling design decisions in applied statistics.

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES

- Investigate factors influencing contraceptive method choice among married women  
- Compare multiple probability-based sampling methods  
- Estimate population means and proportions  
- Evaluate estimator precision using **95% confidence intervals**  
- Identify the most reliable and precise sampling design

## 📂 DATASET DESCRIPTION

- **Source:** National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey  
- **Population Size:** 1,473 married women  
- **Eligibility:** Women not pregnant or uncertain of pregnancy status  
- **Sample Size:** 100 observations per sampling method  

### VARIABLES

**Response Variable:**  
- Contraceptive method used  
  - No use  
  - Short-term use  
  - Long-term use  

**Explanatory Variables (9):**  
- Wife’s age  
- Wife’s education  
- Husband’s education  
- Number of children  
- Religion  
- Working status  
- Husband’s occupation  
- Standard of living  
- Media exposure

## 🧪 SAMPLING METHODS IMPLEMENTED

1. **Simple Random Sampling with Replacement (SRSWR)**  
2. **Simple Random Sampling without Replacement (SRSWOR)**  
3. **Stratified Sampling**  
   - Stratified by wife’s education level  
   - Proportional allocation across strata  
4. **Cluster Sampling**  
   - Clusters defined by husband’s occupation  

All methods used the same sample size to ensure fair comparison.

## 📈 KEY RESULTS & FINDINGS

- **Stratified sampling consistently produced the most precise estimates**
  - Narrower 95% confidence intervals  
  - Reduced variability  
  - More stable population estimates  
- Simple random sampling methods performed adequately but with higher variance  
- Cluster sampling showed the widest confidence intervals and least reliability  

These results empirically demonstrate that **sampling design has a substantial impact on statistical inference**.

## 🏆 CONCLUSION

The study identified **stratified sampling** as the most effective method for estimating contraceptive use in this population. By ensuring proportional representation of key subgroups, stratified sampling significantly improves precision and reliability.

This project achieved a **final mark of 94.5%**, reflecting strong analytical rigor, clear interpretation, and effective application of applied probability models.
